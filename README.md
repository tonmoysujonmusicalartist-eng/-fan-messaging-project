# -fan-messaging-project
A simple concept project for building a fan communication system using Twilio WhatsApp Messaging API.
# Fan Messaging Project (Concept Demo)

This is a concept project created to demonstrate my personal use case for Twilio verification.  
I am a public figure & musician, and I want to use Twilio to communicate with my fans through WhatsApp or SMS.

## Purpose
- Send updates to fans (music releases, announcements)
- Receive messages from fans
- Manage communication more efficiently using Twilio's messaging API

## Status
This is only a **mockup project**, not a working application yet.  
It is created specifically for Twilio account review and verification.

## Mockup Screens (Concept)
